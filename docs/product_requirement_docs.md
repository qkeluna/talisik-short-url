# Talisik Short URL - Product Requirements Document

## Project Overview

### Vision Statement

Talisik Short URL is a privacy-focused URL shortening service designed as both a reusable Python library and standalone web service. Built with Kaizen principles for sustainable, incremental development, it prioritizes user privacy while providing enterprise-grade functionality.

### Mission

To provide developers and organizations with a reliable, privacy-first URL shortening solution that can be easily integrated as a library or deployed as a service, with a focus on simplicity, security, and user control.

## Problem Statement

### Primary Problems Addressed

1. **Privacy Concerns with Existing Services**

   - Most URL shorteners track user behavior extensively
   - Limited control over data retention and usage
   - No transparency in analytics collection

2. **Vendor Lock-in and Dependency Issues**

   - Reliance on third-party services for critical functionality
   - Risk of service discontinuation (bit.ly, TinyURL changes)
   - Limited customization and control

3. **Developer Integration Challenges**

   - Lack of embeddable libraries for internal use
   - Complex API integrations with existing services
   - No self-hosted options with simple deployment

4. **Feature Gaps in Current Solutions**
   - Limited custom short code support
   - No programmatic expiration management
   - Insufficient analytics control

## Target Audience
